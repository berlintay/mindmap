# Psychogenic Shivers (Frisson)

## Definition

Psychogenic shivers, also known as frisson, refer to a sudden feeling of excitement or emotional arousal that triggers a brief sensation of shivers or goosebumps. This response is typically triggered by stimuli that have a significant emotional impact or are unexpected.

## Causes

Frisson can be triggered by various stimuli, such as:
- Listening to powerful or emotionally charged music
- Experiencing a moving scene in a film or a piece of art
- Encountering unexpected beauty in nature or in artistic expressions

## Physiological Response

The phenomenon involves a complex interaction within the brain, leading to the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. This release causes the physical sensation of shivers or goosebumps, mediated by the autonomic nervous system.

## Experience

The experience of frisson is highly individual, with some people being more prone to it than others. It is typically described as a brief, intense feeling of pleasure or awe.# Psychogenic Shivers and ASMR: An Overview

## Psychogenic Shivers (Frisson)

### Definition
Psychogenic shivers, or frisson, refer to a sudden feeling of excitement or emotional arousal causing a brief sensation of shivers or goosebumps, typically in response to stimuli with significant emotional impact or unexpectedness.

### Causes
Frisson can be triggered by auditory or visual stimuli that evoke strong emotions or aesthetic appreciation, such as powerful music, moving cinematic scenes, or the beauty of nature.

### Physiological Response
The phenomenon involves dopamine release, associated with the brain's pleasure and reward system, leading to the physical sensation of shivers or goosebumps through the autonomic nervous system's response.

### Experience
The experience is brief, pleasurable, or exhilarating, varying widely among individuals in terms of triggers and sensitivity.

## ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response)

### Definition
ASMR is characterized by a tingling sensation, starting on the scalp and moving down the neck and upper spine, triggered by specific auditory or visual stimuli related to personal attention, gentle sounds, or repetitive motions.

### Causes
Triggers include whispering, tapping, slow movements, and meticulous tasks, differing from frisson's emotionally charged stimuli.

### Physiological Response
The mechanisms behind ASMR are not fully understood but are believed to involve a relaxation response and possibly the release of endorphins, serotonin, and oxytocin.

### Experience
ASMR is relaxing and often sleep-inducing, with longer-lasting effects than frisson, sought for its calming effects on stress and insomnia.

## Correlation Between Psychogenic Shivers and ASMR

Both phenomena are sensory-driven, leading to physical reactions. They illustrate the complex interplay between sensory inputs and the brain's interpretation, resulting in diverse physical and emotional responses. The main differences lie in the stimuli, emotional response, and physiological mechanisms.

## Research and Interest

Both psychogenic shivers and ASMR have garnered interest in psychological and neuroscientific research, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms and implications for sensory and emotional processing.
