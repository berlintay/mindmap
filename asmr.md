# ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response)

## Definition

ASMR is a sensory phenomenon characterized by a tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. This sensation is triggered by specific auditory or visual stimuli, often associated with relaxation and well-being.

## Causes

Common triggers for ASMR include:
- Whispering or soft-speaking voices
- Sounds of tapping, scratching, or crinkling
- Close personal attention from someone
- Watching someone perform a meticulous task

## Physiological Response

While the exact physiological mechanisms behind ASMR are not fully understood, it is believed to involve the release of endorphins, serotonin, and possibly oxytocin, contributing to feelings of relaxation and contentment.

## Experience

Individuals who experience ASMR report feeling deeply relaxed, with some using ASMR videos or recordings to help alleviate stress, anxiety, or insomnia. The experience is subjective and varies greatly from person to person.
