# Correlation Between Psychogenic Shivers and ASMR

While psychogenic shivers (frisson) and ASMR are distinct phenomena, they share some commonalities in how sensory experiences can elicit physical and emotional responses. Both involve a complex interplay between the brain's processing of sensory inputs and the physiological reactions they trigger.

## Shared Aspects

- **Sensory Elicitation:** Both are triggered by specific types of sensory experiences, though the nature of these stimuli differs.
- **Physical Sensation:** Each phenomenon produces a physical sensation (shivers/goosebumps for frisson and tingling for ASMR) that is generally perceived as pleasurable.
- **Emotional Reaction:** Both can evoke strong emotional reactions, whether it's awe and exhilaration in frisson or relaxation and comfort in ASMR.

## Key Differences

- **Triggers:** Frisson is often triggered by emotionally powerful stimuli, such as music or art, while ASMR typically results from softer, more subtle stimuli, like whispering or tapping.
- **Experience Duration:** The sensation of frisson is usually brief and intense, whereas ASMR can provide a prolonged experience of relaxation.
- **Physiological Basis:** While both involve neurological responses, the specific mechanisms and neurotransmitters involved may differ, with frisson associated with dopamine release and ASMR possibly involving endorphins and oxytocin.

## Research and Interest

The study of both phenomena is ongoing, with research aimed at better understanding their neurological underpinnings, potential therapeutic applications, and the broader implications for sensory and emotional processing.
